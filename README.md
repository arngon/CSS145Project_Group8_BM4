**Project Overview**
This project delves into the world of anime, utilizing the MyAnimeList dataset to explore various aspects of anime and user preferences. The data encompasses details about anime titles, user demographics, and individual watchlists. 

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Anime Recommendation System:** Build a recommendation system using a supervised learning approach and cosine similarity to suggest anime based on genre, rating, and member count.
2. **Anime Score Forecasting:** Employ ARIMA and Prophet models to forecast future trends in average anime scores, considering factors like seasonal variations and overall industry trends.

**Data and Methodology:**
* **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features were extracted and preprocessed for model training.
* **Model Implementation:**
    - **Supervised Learning:** A content-based filtering approach was used to recommend anime based on similarities in genre, rating, and member count.
    - **ARIMA and Prophet:** These models were applied to forecast average anime scores over time, considering seasonal patterns and long-term trends.

**Results and Insights:**

* **Anime Recommendation System:** The system effectively recommends anime based on content-based features, providing personalized suggestions.
* **Anime Score Forecasting:** The ARIMA and Prophet models provide insights into potential trends and seasonal variations in anime scores, helping to understand the evolving landscape of anime.

**Future Directions:**
* Explore advanced recommendation techniques, such as hybrid approaches that combine content-based and collaborative filtering.
* Incorporate user-specific preferences and behavior data to further personalize recommendations.
* Experiment with more sophisticated time series forecasting models to capture complex patterns in anime trends.
